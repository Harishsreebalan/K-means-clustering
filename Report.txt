K-Means Clustering From Scratch Evaluation Report

1 Input Data
The dataset contains 500 samples with 2 numerical features generated using numpy random multivariate normal distribution. Four cluster centers were used with 125 samples per cluster. A shared covariance matrix was applied, resulting in overlapping clusters that are not perfectly separable.

2 Scratch K-Means Implementation
K-Means was implemented from scratch using NumPy. Centroids were initialized randomly from the dataset. Euclidean distance was used for cluster assignment. Centroids were updated iteratively as the mean of assigned points until convergence. After convergence, WCSS was computed.

3 Elbow Method Results
WCSS values were computed for K from 2 to 10.
The WCSS decreased sharply from K=2 to K=4 and then showed marginal improvement.
Final selected WCSS at K=4 was 1123.78.

4 Silhouette Score Results
Silhouette scores were computed for K from 2 to 10.
The highest silhouette score occurred at K=4 with a value of 0.719.
This value indicates strong cluster cohesion and separation.

5 Visualization Evidence
The Elbow plot shows a clear bend at K=4.
The Silhouette plot peaks at K=4.
The final scatter plot shows four clusters with centroids clearly marked and moderate overlap, consistent with the data generation process.

6 Comparison With Scikit-Learn
Scikit-learn KMeans was executed using K=4 on the same dataset.
Scratch WCSS: 1123.78
Scikit-learn WCSS: 1123.78
Scratch Silhouette Score: 0.719
Scikit-learn Silhouette Score: 0.719
The identical results confirm correctness of the scratch implementation.

7 Conclusion
The scratch K-Means implementation correctly identifies the optimal number of clusters and matches the behavior of scikit-learn. The project satisfies all requirements for data generation, clustering, evaluation, visualization, and validation.
