K Means Clustering From Scratch Using NumPy

Project Overview
This repository contains an academic project focused on implementing and evaluating the K Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy. The project includes a complete Python implementation, visualization outputs, and a separate detailed text based analysis report.

Project Files
1 kmeans_from_scratch.ipynb
This file contains the complete Python code implementation of the K Means algorithm from scratch. It includes synthetic data generation, K optimization using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score, final clustering visualization, and comparison with scikit learn KMeans.

2 report.txt
This file contains the detailed text based project report. It includes input data characteristics, explanation of the scratch algorithm, interpretation of WCSS and Silhouette analysis, discussion of visualization results, comparison with scikit learn, and final conclusions.

Execution Instructions
Open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all cells to reproduce the results and visualizations described in the report.

Purpose
This project is developed strictly for educational and academic evaluation purposes.
